# point-generator
This is a simple generative AI example. The demonstration generates colored points in a specific distribution, such as a Pi-shape distribution in the example. You can change the target distribution in the same way.  

## Models
The demonstration demonstrates 3 approaches, including VAE and auto-regressive model.  
  
- [Here](https://github.com/yhyu/point-generator/blob/main/src/train.ipynb) is a simple auto-regressive model using transformer decoder.  
- [Here](https://github.com/yhyu/point-generator/blob/main/src/train_vae_mlp.ipynb) is a simple VAE model using MLP.  
- [Here](https://github.com/yhyu/point-generator/blob/main/src/train_vae_transformer.ipynb) is an VAE model using transformer encoder and decoder.
